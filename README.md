# Type-written-Physics-notes

This repository contains all the type written Physics notes that I typed out as
a means to consolidate my Physics learning. 

## Topics in progress:
1. Differential geometry (Summary of PC4274 in NUS)

## Topics I hope to add in the future:
1. Basics of Quantum Mechanics (Summary of PC2130 and PC3130)
2. Basic Classical Mechanics (Summary of PC2132)
3. Basic Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics (Summary of PC2230 and PC4241)
4. Basic Electricity and Magnetism (Summary of PC2131 and PC3231)
5. Basic Mathematical Methods (Summary of PC2174)

## Topics completed:
1. Coming soon!
